            The history of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict traces back to the late 19th century when Zionists sought to establish a homeland for the Jewish people in Ottoman-controlled Palestine, a region roughly corresponding to the Land of Israel in Jewish tradition. The Balfour Declaration of 1917, issued by the British government, endorsed the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, which led to an influx of Jewish immigrants to the region. Following World War II and the Holocaust, international pressure mounted for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, leading to the creation of Israel in 1948.

            The establishment of Israel, and the war that followed and preceded it, led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who became refugees, sparking a decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people. The Palestinians seek to establish their own independent state in at least a part of historic Palestine. Israeli defense of its own borders, control over the West Bank, the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip, and Palestinian internal politics currently make this goal out of reach.

          <p>Before World War I, the Middle East region, including the Ottoman Syria (the southern part of which are regarded as Palestine), was under the control of the Ottoman Empire for nearly 400 years. Towards the end of the 19th century, Palestine, which was divided between the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem, Syria Vilayet and Beirut Vilayet, was inhabited predominantly by Arab Muslims, both farmers and Bedouin (principally in the Negev and Jordan Valley), with smaller numbers of Christians (mostly Arabs), Druze, Circassians and Jews (predominantly Sephardic). At that time most of the Jews worldwide lived outside Palestine, predominantly in eastern and central Europe,with significant communities in the Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Americas.</p>

            On May 15, 1947, the General Assembly of the newly formed United Nations resolved that a committee, (United Nations Special Committee on Palestine), be created "to prepare for consideration at the next regular session of the Assembly a report on the question of Palestine". The Committee was to consist of the representatives of Australia, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala, India, Iran, Netherlands, Peru, Sweden, Uruguay and Yugoslavia.

          <p>The termination of the British mandate over Palestine and the Israeli Declaration of Independence sparked a full-scale war (1948 Arab–Israeli War) which erupted after May 14, 1948. On 15–16 May, the four armies of Jordan, Syria, Egypt and Iraq invaded/intervened in what had been the area of the British Mandate followed not long after by units from Lebanon.

            In 2021, yet another war between Israel and Gaza occurred resulting in over 250 casualties.As the war went on, violent conflict was ignited within Israel as well. Policy analysts believe that the war decreased the chances of Israeli-Palestinian bilateral talks.

            In November 2022, with the election of the 37th government of Israel, a coalition government led by Benjamin Netanyahu and notable for its inclusion of far-right politicians, violence in the conflict has increased, with a rise in military actions such as the July 2023 Jenin incursion and Palestinian political violence producing the highest death toll in the conflict since 2005.
            
            On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a large-scale offensive against Israel, during which Hamas initially fired at least 2,200 rockets at Israel from the Gaza Strip. Simultaneously, hundreds of Palestinian militants breached the border, entering Israel on foot and with motor vehicles. They engaged in gun battles with Israeli security forces, murdered Israeli civilians and took over Israeli towns and military bases. The attack resulted in more than 1,400 Israelis killed and at least 200 kidnapped to Gaza, mostly civilian. Following the initial onslaught, Israeli forces managed to clear Hamas militants from southern Israel. Subsequent airstrikes in the Gaza Strip led to significant Palestinian casualties and exacerbated the humanitarian situation.
